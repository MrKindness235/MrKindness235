# Who I am?
Sometimes I wonder that, who is me and who will I be.
Many times I ponder, log In my PC to try and reminisce.
Yet I find myself wondering, 
```
Oh why? Why is it like this?
Why is my me so important to thee and to the rest of the ones who heed the call of questioning me?
Is it wrong? Is it far? 
Is it so much adrift that you worry for me?
I am off? Because if I am I cannot find the switch to turn it up!
Is it my birthright? Is it that? My blood that cursed me with life and despair?
Or is it my name? The one that calls all the angels to listen and the devils to rest?
```
Time to log off, time to go out.
Time to reflect and scare the fog away.
Won't help If I stay cowardly in my cave.
I think of myself and my birth.
Born upside down, wrong way around.
But luckily I have found that this perspective, wrongly described as defective, is reflective and affective into lands.
Lands of green that I travel while I unravel the mysteries of this world and the clouds.
Clouds of white that show me the faces of the people around.
The people around me, that call me and applaud me for being myself!
So I sit down, Log in to ask myself again!
```
Why do you care so much for all those lies you've been feed?!
Why can't you see that from your chains you've been freed?!
The locks around your wrists and neck are broken since you haven spoken your true name!
So say, why can't accept that you are good?
That you are enough being you?
```
I'm log in off again.
